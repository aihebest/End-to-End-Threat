# End-to-End-Threat
End-to-End Threat Detection and Incident Response with Wazuh

Project Overview:
Design and implement a comprehensive threat detection and incident response system using Wazuh. This project will demonstrate your ability to monitor, detect, and respond to security threats in a simulated environment. You can highlight your expertise in log analysis, intrusion detection, vulnerability management, and automated response.

Key Components of the Project:
Threat Detection:

Configure Wazuh to monitor endpoints (e.g., Windows, Linux, or macOS systems) in your local network.

Set up rules to detect common threats such as:

Brute-force attacks (e.g., SSH or RDP login attempts).

Malware execution (e.g., detection of known malicious processes or files).

Unauthorized changes to critical system files or configurations.

Suspicious network activity (e.g., port scanning, unusual outbound connections).

Log Analysis and Correlation:

Integrate Wazuh with syslog or other log sources (e.g., firewalls, routers, or web servers) to centralize logs.

Create custom rules and decoders to correlate events and identify potential security incidents.

Use Wazuh’s built-in ruleset to detect known attack patterns (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK techniques).

Vulnerability Management:

Use Wazuh’s Vulnerability Detector module to scan endpoints for known vulnerabilities (e.g., missing patches, outdated software).

Generate reports and prioritize remediation efforts based on severity.

Automated Response:

Configure active response in Wazuh to automatically block IP addresses or terminate malicious processes when a threat is detected.

For example:

Block an IP address after multiple failed SSH login attempts.

Quarantine a file if it matches a known malware signature.

Visualization and Reporting:

Use Wazuh’s Kibana integration to create dashboards that visualize security events, alerts, and trends.

Build custom dashboards to showcase:

Real-time threat detection.

Top attack vectors.

Vulnerabilities by severity.

Incident response actions.

##Simulated Attack Scenario##:

Simulate an attack on your local network (e.g., using tools like Metasploit or Atomic Red Team) to test your Wazuh setup.
